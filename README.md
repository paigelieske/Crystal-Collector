At the start of the game you are given a random number to match.

By clicking on one of the four crystals, you will add a specific amount of points to your total.

You win the game if your total matches the random number; but you lose if your total goes over.

Pay attention. The value of each crystal is hidden and they change with every game.

Good luck!
